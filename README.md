# Surfs Up Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: Purpose of This Analysis

While on vacation in Hawaii last year I discovred a new found passion for surfing. I had been trying to come up with a plan that will let me not just return to Hawaii, but live thre permanently. I finally came up with an idea that I thought is foolsproof, a surf and shake shop, serving surf boards and ice cream to local and tourists. 

I had some savings I am willing to invest, but needed some real investor backing to get the project off the ground. So I put together a strong business plan I reached out to an investor, W. Avy who is famous for his love of surfing. The first meeting went well with W. Avy, but he did have one concern, the weather. He was extremely interested,and even had invested in a surf shop earlier in his career. Unfortunately, he didn't ask for any weather analysis and his early venture was rained out of existance. 

W. Avy knows I had been learning how to properly analyze data and asked me if I could run some analytics on a weather dataset he has on the very island where I'd wantd to open my shop.


## Results: 

W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

A summary of statistics for those months are below. June on the left and december on the right.
